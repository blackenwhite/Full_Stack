// Intro 
A UI is built which is like a movie theatre website where we can pick up our seats 
when we pick the movie.
We have different prices for different movies, 
a legend where blue shows already occupied seats and white shows 'not-yet-occupied'.
The number of seats you filled for, shows your total bill.
----------
We will use local storage for storing the seats that you filled.

---------------------------//----------------
--HTML file description---
The title of the page is given to be Movie seat booking , and the linking to the css file and javascript file are made.
------------------Select Movie part-----------------------
A div container of class "movie-container" is made. Label of 'Select a Movie' is added.
There is a select box inside this container. It has id="movie" so that we can use it through the script file.
Inside the select box there are 4 options where the value is the cost of a ticket for that particular movie.
--------------------Showcase-----------------
Next, we have created a showcase container. It has classes of occupied, not occupied and selected seats.
